36,"In addition to positions and policies articulated earlier in her career, Haley has taken further stances during her campaign for the U.S. presidency. Haley addressed the issue of abortion as far back as her service in the South Carolina state legislature. In a 2023 interview, she elaborated on that subject, pointing to a proposal from Senator Lindsey Graham that would establish a national 15-week abortion ban, with exceptions for r***, incest, health, and life of the mother.Haley said that the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, known as the ""Don't Say Gay"" law, does not go far enough, in that prohibitions against discussing sex and sexuality before third grade should be subject to opt-in parental consent, and suggesting they should be extended until seventh grade.In an opinion article published by the New York Post on 24 February 2023, Haley vowed to ""cut every cent in foreign aid for countries that hate [the United States]"". She listed Iraq, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, China, and Cuba as such countries, and labeled them ""enemies"" of the United States.In June 2023, Haley attacked both Trump and Ron DeSantis for their positions regarding the on-going Russian invasion of Ukraine.","[-2.03952007e-02  3.45970839e-05  9.81618068e-04 ...  2.00121291e-03

On February 1, 2023, it was reported that Haley was going to announce a bid for the presidency on February 15, making her the first challenger to former President Donald Trump's campaign. Haley will be the third Indian American politician to seek a presidential nomination following Bobby Jindal and Vice President Kamala Harris. Haley had previously claimed that she would not run for the candidacy if Trump also sought the nomination.On February 14, 2023, she officially announced her candidacy. In an ad titled ""Strong and Proud,"" Haley made it official that she is running for president in 2024. She became the second major candidate to announce her run for the 2024 Republican presidential primaries. Haley is the first woman of color to be a major candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, though she is not the first such non-major candidate (e.g. see Isabell Masters). She is the first woman who has been a governor to run for president.On February 15, 2023, Haley held a campaign announcement rally with supporters in Charleston, South Carolina and received an endorsement from freedom caucus member Ralph Norman, with him saying that she would have been in the group of Congressional Republicans opposing Speaker Kevin McCarthy. She also was joined by the mother of Otto Warmbier who praised Haley for changing her life following her son's death. Haley also announced that she supports congressional term limits and ""mandatory mental competence tests for politicians over 75 years old,"" which received mixed feedback from U.S. Senators.The efficacy of Haley's campaign is debated among experts and commentators. The Wall Street Journal's Editorial Board wrote that there is “no clear rationale for her candidacy.” Political columnists at the New York Times say the two-year governor and former US ambassador to the United Nations should not be taken seriously. ""Nikki Haley Will Not Be the Next President,"" read the caption. However, Politico's Chief Washington Correspondent, Ryan Lizza, wrote that Haley ""shouldn't be counted out just yet"" due to her relative youth, the tradition of volatility and upsets in Republican primaries, and her electability. Likewise, Former Lieutenant Governor of Georgia Geoff Duncan wrote that Nikki Haley's candidacy ""is a race to watch"" while citing her prior executive and foreign policy experience, along with her prior record of supporting popular conservative bills and policies while in office.","[-0.04437492 -0.02245679  0.00017384 ... -0.0044439   0.00078915

It was assumed that putting Haley on Trump's 2020 ticket could help his performance with suburban women, a demographic he had so far struggled to mobilize in his favor. However, Trump promptly denied these speculations saying ""I love Nikki and there are places for Nikki, and Nikki's future is great, but Mike Pence is the person, 100%. We won together.

She was the only freshman legislator named to a whip spot at the time.One of Haley's stated goals was to lower taxes. When Mark Sanford was governor of South Carolina, Haley voted against a proposed cigarette surtax despite criticism that the revenue from the tax would have been used for smoking prevention programs and cancer research related to smoking. She voted for a bill that raised sales taxes from five cents per dollar to six cents per dollar. The bill exempted sales tax on unprepared food such as canned goods. The same bill also exempts property tax on ""owner-occupied residential property"" except for the taxes due from what is still owed on the property.Haley implemented a plan in which teachers' salaries would be based on not only seniority and qualifications but also job performance, as determined by evaluations and reports from principals, students, and parents.

She voted in favor of a law that requires employers to be able to prove that newly hired employees are legal residents of the United States, and also requires all immigrants to carry documentation at all times proving that they are legally in the United States. Haley signed an ""Arizona-style"" law cracking down on illegal immigration in June 2011. The law is the subject of a lawsuit initiated by the United States Justice Department on numerous grounds, including claims the immigration law violates the Supremacy Clause.

In 2016, she re-signed a new state law that bans abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy.Haley has voted in favor of some bills relating to abortion that were tabled or rejected, including the Inclusion of Unborn Child/Fetus in Definition for Civil Suits Amendment, Prohibiting Employment Termination Due to Abortion Waiting Period amendment, and Exempting Cases of R*** from Abortion Waiting Period amendment. The latter would have allowed specific cases of women to not have to wait the mandatory 24 hours before having an abortion.As a state legislator, her assignments included the Committee on Labor, Commerce and Industry, and the Committee on Medical, Military, Public and Municipal Affairs.

Haley deleted the re-tweet after a complaint was filed by the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The Office of Special Counsel issued a reprimand by letter but did not recommend any further action be taken against Haley. The special counsel's letter warned Haley that any future violation could be considered ""a willful and knowing violation of the law"".In October 2017, the U.S., along with 13 other nations, voted against a U.N. resolution titled ""The Question of the Death Penalty"", which condemned the use of capital punishment when ""applied arbitrarily or in a discriminatory manner"" and specifically condemned ""the imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations."" LGBTQ rights advocates in the U.S., including the Human Rights Campaign, were critical of the vote. After the vote, a State Department spokeswoman announced that ""We voted against that resolution because of broader concerns with the resolution's approach in condemning the death penalty in all circumstances ...

In that January 25 television interview, she also declared that she would vote against impeachment, and that ""They will bring about impeachment, yet they say they are for unity.

The Houthis were fighting the Saudi-backed Hadi government. She said that the ""fight against Iranian aggression is the world's fight."" Iranian U.N. mission spokesman Alireza Miryusefi said in response that ""These accusations seek also to cover up for the Saudi war crimes in Yemen, with the US complicity, and divert attention from the stalemate war of aggression against the Yemenis."" Iran likened Haley's presentation to that of then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Haley also said that ""It's hard to find a conflict or terrorist group in the Middle East that doesn't have Iran's fingerprints all over it"", but she did not mention the U.S. role in Saudi-led intervention in Yemen and Saudi-led coalition's blockade of Yemen.In December 2017, Haley said that the women who had accused President Trump of touching or groping them without their consent ""should be heard.""In January 2018, she supported President Trump's withholding aid to Palestinians through the U.N.

""When the Human Rights Council treats Israel worse than North Korea, Iran, and Syria, it is the Council itself that is foolish and unworthy of its name. It is time for the countries who know better to demand changes,"" Haley said in a statement at the time, pointing to the council's adoption of five resolutions condemning Israel.On October 9, 2018, she tendered her resignation as the U.N. ambassador, which President Donald Trump accepted. Haley's resignation emerged a day after an anti-corruption watchdog accused her of accepting seven luxury private plane trips as gifts from South Carolina business leaders. The watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), was the first to break this story after requesting an Inspector General investigation. Haley listed these seven flights as gifts on a 2018 financial disclosure, claiming that they are exempt from ethics violations as they were gifted by personal contacts. A spokesperson for CREW said they have no reason to believe that this was related to her resignation as ambassador.In October 2018, Haley raised the issue of China's re-education camps and human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority. She said that ""At least a million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities have been imprisoned in so-called 're-education camps' in western China,"" and detainees are ""tortured … forced to renounce their religion and to pledge allegiance to the Communist Party.""Haley left her position as U.N. ambassador on December 31, 2018.
